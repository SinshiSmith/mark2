             Burj Khalifa has redefined what is possible in the design and engineering of supertall buildings.
             By combining cutting-edge technologies and cultural influences, the building serves as a global
             icon that is both a model for future urban centers and speaks to the global movement towards compact,
              livable urban areas. The Tower and its surrounding neighborhood are more centralized than any other new development in Dubai.
              At the center of a new downtown neighborhood, Burj Khalifa’s mixed-use program focuses
              the area’s development density and provides direct connections to mass transit systems
